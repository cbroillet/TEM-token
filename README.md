# TEM-token
Smart contracts for "Token Estate Marketplace" token sale.

We use a standard ERC20 token as the foundation for our token. We will add our business logic as we add stairs to a building.

## Testing
The testing framework is [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/), the Ethereum Swiss Army knife. We took over all the ERC20 standard token tests to be sure our modifications will not impact it. 

## Testing
We believe using secure, tested and community-audited code is the right way to build a great and secure application. It's why we use [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity) library as a foundation for writing secure token Smart Contracts on Ethereum.

If you find a security issue, please email security@tokenestate.io.

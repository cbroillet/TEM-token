# TEM-token
Smart contract for the "Token Estate" token sale. On top of the standard ERC20 standard, which is the foundation of the TEM-token, we have added a dividend payment reflecting the stake of the token holder

## Testing
The testing framework is [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/). Our tests folder includes the ERC20 standard tests to prevent from any regression

## Security
We believe that using secure, tested and community-audited code is the right way to develop smart contracts on Ethereum. This is why we use the [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity) library 

If you find a security issue, please email security@tokenestate.io.
